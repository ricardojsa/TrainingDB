## TrainingDB

This repository is just a demonstration of basic SQL commands in SQLite to show a little management and control of the database.

## Kaggle
The data was downloaded in https://www.kaggle.com/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us?select=PoliceKillingsUS.csv.
If you need some database for practice I highly recommend starting with kaggle website where you can find a bunch of trustworthy data as source for practice 

For testing the code and instruction, you can download the data from this repository and test the commands presented in the instructions.sql file.

## Upcoming
In the future this repository may get a little more than just management of data but also how to create a database with consistent and relational form.
